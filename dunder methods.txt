1- init
 If you've used classes, this is a method you must have used before.
 The init method is used to create an instance of the class. The init method defined above accepts
 a list of names as parameters and stores them in the class's list of names.
 Also, it populates the version dictionary.
 We also checked the list. Throws an exception if the list is empty. 


2-str
The str method is useful when we want to use an instance of our class in a print statement.
 As mentioned, it usually returns a memory object.
 But we can override the str method to suit our needs.

3-setitem
When assigning values in a dictionary, the setitem method is invoked.


4-getitem
The getitem method is like the setitem method, the major difference being
that the getitem method is called when we use the [] operator of a dictionary

5-delitem
separate Delimiters are similar to the setitem and getitem methods. To avoid repetition,
 let's move on to the implementation and use cases.

6-len
In a dictionary, the len method returns the number of items in the list, 
or the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.
 We can also define a len method for our class.

7-add
The add method is called when using the + operator.
 We can define a custom add method for our class.

8-call
When invoking a function like func(), we are invoking the call method.

9-contains
Use the contains method when using the in operator. 
The return value must be a boolean.

10-add
The iadd method is like the add method.
 It is invoked when using the += operator
