What is the Encapsulation?
Put the data and functions related to the data or that are performed on it within
a specific category and hide the details of this data from the rest of the program
or from the rest of the other category, and therefore they cannot separate the change 
or effect from each other
This process can be likened to a black box in which data is entered and output is
obtained without knowing the details of its acquisition.

** In Python, Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring thedata 
members of a class either as private or protected.

Why packaging?
1- It helps the developer to fully interact with his data and everything is arranged to prevent errors
2- Preserve the values ​​without ambiguity
3- Separating the focus joint from behavioral control
4- It helps in the testing process because we know what each class should do
Conclusion:
Encapsulation helps us maintain the system and avoid errors, we have high control,
 test and change data without affecting or modifying the whole program, 
which facilitates the process of error detection and prevents the process of code complexity

example:
class car:
gastype=petrol
getfuelpercentage():
return fuel%

bmw = new car()
bmw.getfuelpercentage()

what is abstraction?
Show only the necessary details of the thing, otherwise it is hidden
This is similar to how we know how to drive a car, but other mechanical details are not needed to drive this machine

**The idea is to help programmers develop programs quickly and easily without having 
to know full details and also helps maintain security
